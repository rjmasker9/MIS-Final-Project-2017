<p style="text-align:right"> Here's another picture of my family including my amazing <br>
Mom. She is a nurse at Allen Hospital and also does hospice visits on occasion. My mom <br>
loves us but she was also kinda mad she didn't have any daughters. </p>

<p> Aside from my family, I grew up with a great group of friends. Even <br>
though we all have transitioned into college, we're all still pretty close. <br>
This picture was taken this year on my friend Leyton's (in the front middle) <br>
birthday in Iowa City. </p>

<p style="text-align:right"> Another thing to know about me is that I have a <br>
girlfriend named Shelby, and she attends UNI. She is double majoring in <br>
Elementary and Early Childhood Education. I meet her this year because one <br>
of her best friends lives in the same dorm as me. </p>
