<p>For my future plans, I'm planning on continuing at Hawkeye for 2
years to recieve my AA degree in Business Administration. After graduation
I plan on attending UNI. At UNI I would like to major in either marketing
or finance. I'd like to graduate from UNI with my Bachelor's by 2021.</p>

<p>Beyond college I don't have many plans. I would like to get a job as
soon as I can out of college so I can begin paying off my student loans.
As far as where I want to live, I would like to stay in Iowa for now at least
but I could see myself going beyond Iowa or even just traveling a lot if that
could be possible.</p>
