<img class="floatleft" src="images/soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer Photo" width="450" height="300">
<br style="clear:left">
<p>One of my favorite hobbies/interests, is sports. With that being said, my <br>
favorite sport is soccer. I played soccer all throughout my high school career <br>
and I have some of my best high school memories during soccer.</p>

<br style="clear:right">
<p style="text-align:right">My favorite vacation I've ever been on was during my junior year of high school <br>
and my mom took my brother and I to San Diego/Vegas for a week. Easily the coolest <br>
vacation I've taken and my first time on a plane. This February though my mom is <br>
taking my brother and I to Mexico which I think might top this vacation. </p>

<br style="clear:left">
<p>There's a couple unique things about me, that a lot of people don't really know <br>
about. The first thing is that I can juggle pretty well and did it in the talent <br>
show with my friend all 4 years of high school. Our teacher who was in charge of <br>
the talent show kind of made us do it, but now looking back I'm glad I did because <br>
we were always the most popular performance.</p>
<img class="floatright" src="images/acl.jpg" alt="ACL Photo" width="260" height="480">
<br style="clear:right">
<p style="text-align:right">Another unique thing about me that actually kinda sucks, is that I have torn my ACL <br>
twice. The first time was while playing soccer and the second time was on a trampoline. <br>
This picture is of me on the first day of school of my senior year and that was one <br>
week after my first surgery. </p>
<img class="floatleft" src="images/hawks.jpg" alt="Iowa Hawkeyes Photo" width="300" height="525">
<br style="clear:left">
<p>Another interest of mine is the Iowa Hawkeyes. My mom and her friend buy 4 season <br>
tickets every year and I end up going to almost every home game if I'm not busy. This <br>
year we were ableto make it to the Iowa vs Ohio State game where we got to rush the <br>
field after they won. </p>
<img class="floatright" src="images/5k.jpg" alt="5k Photo" width="375" height="650">
<br style="clear:right">
<p style="text-align:right">One last interst I have is running in 5K's and this picture shows the last 5k <br>
I ran in September. For that 5k we got to run onto the field at Kinnick Stadium so <br>
it was a pretty cool experience. This was also my first 5k since my 2 ACL surgerys <br>
and I ran it in 22 minutes. </p>
